# Demo GIFs

This folder should contain demo GIFs showcasing the library features.

## Required GIFs

1. **typing.gif** - Shows typing bold text and creating bullet lists
2. **mentions.gif** - Shows typing @username and #hashtag and seeing them turn blue automatically
3. **export.gif** - Shows tapping "Export as Markdown" button and the result

## How to Create

1. Run the Android sample app on your phone/emulator
2. Use a screen recorder app (e.g., "Screen Recorder" on Android)
3. Record short demonstrations of each feature
4. Save the GIFs in this folder with the names above

## Notes

- Keep GIFs under 5MB for GitHub
- Record in portrait or landscape (whichever shows the feature best)
- Keep recordings short (10-30 seconds each)
